# Guidelines and documentation for embeding andorid application

I have a few ideas to embed Android app with react.

- First one and the fastes one, but this method have some issues along the way. And that is using capacitor platform form Ionic Capacitor. Here is the official documentation - https://capacitorjs.com/. Issue with this method is problems with web view, and application is slower on older android devices. I will talk about it more in our interview.

- Second one is to use React Native. In this methode we can use logic from our React project, but it will take more time to create. Using React Native provides us with excelent tools and plugins that will speed up development process. Here is official React Native documentation - https://reactnative.dev/

- Lasst one is using Kotlin programming language for developing andorid app. This methode will take me most time to do. I don't have experience with Kotlin, but if needed i will learn that language. Here is Kotilin official documentation - https://kotlinlang.org/
